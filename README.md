# SceneFlowV2



1. Scene Types (4+): For the scene flow prototype I have a total of 5 scenes. The production scene, Menu, Gameplay, Credits, and Control.

2. Communication between scenes: The comunication is seen in our gameplay, I don't have the code here but I pasted the url in the gameplay scene. In the gameplay the player cannot advance in the level until the puzzle has been completed. 

3. Reachability: Since we don't have a full game the reachability is shown through our menu, being able to access all the scenes through the menu. 

4. Transitions: Between my scenes the transisitions are all fades to black and fading from black.
